# Pretrial Recidivism Predictive Model (PCS Project)

This repository contains the code, analysis, and documentation developed for the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing (PCS) to construct a pretrial recidivism dataset and build an interpretable machine learning model that predicts the likelihood a defendant will reoffend during the pretrial period.

This project was completed at Carnegie Mellon University, Heinz College (Fall 2025) by
**Amy Kang, Selina Pang, Yash Sivramkrishnan, Karry Li, and Casey Mei**.
