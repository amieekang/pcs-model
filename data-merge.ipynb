    "Given the large file sizes of the PSP and CPMC datasets, we gained access to one of CMU's virtual machine so we have more computational memory to run and manipulate these files. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Given the large file size of PSP, we had to drop columns with over 90% missing values to decrease the file size to allow complete uploading. These columns included: \n",
    "\n",
    " ['death_yeardeath_month', 'death_day', 'sor_status', 'release_year', 'release_month', 'release_day', 'inchoate_charge', 'final_charge', 'consec_charge', 'disp3', 'disp4', 'disp5', 'disp6', 'disp7', 'disp8', 'disp9', 'disp10', 'min_sent_year', 'max_sent_year']\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Similarly, we also dropped columns with over 90% missing values in MDJ. These columns included: \n",
    "\n",
    " ['defendantcounty', 'fine', 'fineadjustment', 'restitution', 'restitutionadjustment', 'sentencingjudge', 'penaltyeventtype', 'programtype', 'programperiod', 'startdate', 'enddate', 'facilitylocation']\n",
    "\n",
    " Necessary columns can be added back in during the EDA phase as needed. This step is to bypass the datasets not loading. \n",
    "\n",
    " 3. We identified shared columns between the two datasets: ['dob', 'ori', 'otn', 'grade', 'race', 'id']\n",
    "\n",
    " We decided to merge on OTN then ID because in both datasets, OTN (Offense Tracking Number) identifies a specific criminal case or charge, while ID identifies the individual. Merging on both ensures that we only match the same case and person, not just anyone with a similar OTN, preventing false matches where two people might coincidentally share the same OTN or one person has multiple OTNs.\n",
    "\n",
    " 4. After converting the OTN column to the same data type (string), we did an inner join on OTN and ID. See below: \n",
    "\n",
    " mdj_full = pd.merge(mdj, psp, on=['otn','id'], how='inner')\n",
